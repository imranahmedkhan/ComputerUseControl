Powershell script and windows task to autolock computer repeatedly after a time at night

The script locks the computer only when it sees that the computer is unlocked in the time window.

Currently set to kick off with Windows Task Scheduler at 10:45pm, trigger every 5 minutes for an hour (Assuming the user gives up and goes to bed by then)
